Analysis on the Influence of Mental Illness and Racial Discrimination on Fatal Police Shootings
Racial discrimination and mental illness were analyzed to see which factors correlated in regards to police shootings within the US. Actionable insights were produced from the best predictive models which were used to recommend methods that may reduce these occurrences within the domain as well as other countries. The best predictive model was then used to demonstrate interactive dashboard of all the related factors. 


Overall after thorough analysis and trying out various predicitive models in SAS Enterprise Miner such as Neural Networks, DMine Regression, LARS, Gradient Boosting. The only model that were actually providing with valuable results were Decision Tree and Logisitic Regression Models.

After this was decided, I carried out various experiements with different settings for both targets and after going through approx. 100 + variations of each model. The best model for both targets was the decision tree. This result was analyzed within the PDF given above and further modelled in an interactive manner in PowerBI under the Decomposition Tree model. Only the top 6 nodes from the decision tree were selected to be displayed hence when a user may click on any node in the PowerBI dashboard, it will show them the exact proabability as shown in SAS Enterprise Miner. 

All of these results were analyzed and various suggestions were given including references to possible solution that have already taken place in the years before or planning to take place in the years to come.

For any further clarifications or concerns, please contact me.

To note; this is no way a publication of my FYP, it is just to share the work I am proud of and spent the last year working on. Thank you.
